INTRODUCTION
This JSON Processor project is intended as a simple web application for visualizing, filtering, or otherwise processing JSON data. In particular, it is catered to JSON data collected through the CrossRef API.

Current Version: 0.2 (Development)
Version Notes:
The current vrsion can retrieve JSON data from a CrossRef URL (using jQuery GET method), then displaying on index.HTML. Next steps would be to style these generated <div> elements for easier viewing and creating a search bar element -- the current GET method only gets query from URL determined in script.js.
