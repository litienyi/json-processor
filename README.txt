INTRODUCTION
This JSON Processor project is intended as a simple web application for visualizing, filtering, or otherwise processing JSON data. In particular, it is catered to JSON data collected through the CrossRef API.

Current Version: 1.1 (Beta)
Version Notes:
Added filter function, which allows users to view select Object Properties.

To look forward in the next version:
A search bar on results.html; A function to view unique Object Values in select Properties (e.g. unique titles); A function to view distribution of "references-count" value.
